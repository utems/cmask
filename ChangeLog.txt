	cd to the source/ directory.
	make

  I had to make a couple small changes to make this compile on MacOS X:

	globals.h:  comment out #define D_MAC and uncomment #define D_IRIX.

	parser.h/cpp:  rename "isnumber" function to "myisnumber" due to a 
		conflict with the OS X ctype.h header.

2009-04-19  Anthony Kozar  <akozar@users.sourceforge.net>

	globals.h:  New macro MAX_FILENAME; set to 2048.
	cmask.cpp:	parser.h:	fileio.h:	fileio.cpp:  Most filename char[] variables were only 32 or 33
		bytes long which was easy to overflow and crash.  Replaced
		explicit sizes with MAX_FILENAME macro.
